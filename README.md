## About
This is my implementation of Tetris. It is console based.

There will be some flickering, but otherwise it functions properly.

## Execute
Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed. Clone this repository. In a terminal, navigate to the directory containing tetris.cpp and run `g++ -o tetris tetris.cpp` followed by `tetris` to execute the program.
